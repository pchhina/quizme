# quizme: automatic test generator from user's text file

## This project contains functions to 
- take the user's text file in question/answer format and generates test questions for self quizzing
- since the input file is a plain vanilla ASCII text file, the questions are language agnostic. This opens up possibilities to mix/match any learning material that you are currently focusing on
